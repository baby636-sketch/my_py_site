Supprised after seeing the post title :smile: Well today we will be talking about one of the most popular framework for developing cross platform application using my very favourate HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## According to the official documentation

 > Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

It was released in 2013 for enabling the web developers for making cross platform applications

## What is Electron?

Electronis an framework that lets you compose cross-platform desktop apps from Node.js APIs and Chromium windows. 

The project came into this world as Atom Shell, but got a spiffy new name in 2015 and is now called Electron.

## Apps using ElectronJS

Several large, well-known apps use Electron to offer native desktop experiences such as:

* Atom (Github, OSS text editor)
* Slack
* Brave
* Ghost
* Whatsapp &
* Visual Studio Code

_Whatsapp for Windows is the one which you might have probably used._

> In a nutshell electron renders the you web app or website code in a chrome browser just like you open a website in browser.
Every electron app comes with a chrome browser

## What can electron do? :thinking:

Well electron can do a ton of things such as interacting with the database using NODEjs, manipulating files on machine, accessing OS APIs, and much more.

You can have a look at the official application showcase at [Atom](https://atom.io) for that.

Electron provides JavaScript APIs for several common host OS functions (e.g. app trays, keyboard shortcuts with or without OS focus)
