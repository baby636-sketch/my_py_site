We all have used Chromium a lot, well if you are not aware of what the hell is Chromium, you can guess by the first four letters "Chrom".

According to Wikipedia - 

> Chromium is Google's open-source web browser project. It is a fully functional browser on its own and supplies the vast majority of code for the Google Chrome browser. 
> So Chromium is similar to Chrome but is open source so we can see it's code and in that way we are more secure from the privacy leaks of Chrome.

Well lets leave this and be more specific to our topic of today, the chrome extensions I use daily for my daily development work.

So here's the list of my favourite Chromium extensions.

### Midnight Lizard

Midnight Lizard is the one which I came to know about recently while browsing for a dark mode extension.   Midnight Lizard has a variety of colour schemes for the Developers(We love dark mode) as well as for casual web browsing purpose.

Reading a web page which is flashing light on our face becomes irritating so you can turn on Midnight Lizard and enjoy you browsing, whatever it is :smile:

**Pros:**   

1. **18 colour schemes available.**   
2. **About 11 are dark schemes.**   
3. **Shortcut to switch on and off extension.**   
4. **Small in size.**

**Cons:**

1. **Increases page load time significantly.**
2. **Sometimes freezes the browser.**

### WhatFont

This is my personal favourite. What font helps you to check font-family, size, color, line-height, style, weight of the font by just clicking on  the extension for activating it and then hovering over the font on the web page and clicking on it. You can also get the RGB and Hex color code of the font.

### Postman

Not only me but the whole developer community loves postman. It is used for API(Application Programming Interface) for doing POST, GET, PUT, DELETE and many more calls & testing.
